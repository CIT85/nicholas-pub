# Breakfast Ideas


## Breakfast Site

This site I will be creating will go over breakfast ideas ranging from diffrent 
cultures. I think it would be a gentle way into making a site , so far we have gone over tables
and images which tables can be used for measurments. Images can give a visual appeal for what
the page has to offer. If this site were published it would be ideal for people to rate the page 
or give the own breakfast ideas to share with others. This would be a light hearted site no need
for a complicated site, a viewer I hope would just be waking up making simple decisions, this 
site can reflect that by welcoming light colors and easy to read font that says goodmorning. 

## outline

Sent to Chatgpt, I inserted my paragraph explaining this is my idea of the site, to follow up with 
: 'what would it expect to see in the navigation & 4 other pages the response Visitors should immediately see a simple, friendly, and clear navigation. Something like: Home ,recipes, Tips & Inspiration, Meal Plans, About, Contact'

Sent to Chatgpt,Good response on the structure , how would you categorize types of breakfast , like oatmeal pourage, pancake, crepes, chorizo , savory. the response :
' Global Breakfasts, Quick & Easy, Sweet Breakfasts, Savory Breakfasts, Healthy & Wholesome, Brunch & Weekend Specials'

I liked the feedback on what how to categorize my site with that I depicted what I like from Chatgpt and will put my own twist.

## Typography Enhancements

For this project, I applied consistent typography styles across all pages to create a clear visual hierarchy and improve readability. The elements and styles implemented include: Hedings, Paragrapghs, links.

## Decorative or Positional Enhancements

In this section, I applied visual and positional styling to enhance the page’s design. The mark element was styled with a background color and bold text to highlight important phrases. The first paragraph in the footer was made sticky at the top to remain visible during scrolling. Images inside figure were given rounded corners and a subtle border for a callout effect. Additionally, an optional aside was floated to the right to create a visually distinct sidebar. These enhancements improve user experience and add decorative interest to the page without using advanced layout techniques.

# Accessibility

Responsive background colors improve accessibility by maintaining good contrast and readability across devices, reducing eye strain in different lighting conditions, and ensuring that users with visual or cognitive impairments can comfortably view content. By adjusting colors based on screen size, the design stays clear, consistent, and easier to use for everyone.

## Phase 3 Overview

My layout primarily uses Flexbox for navigation and color swatches, allowing horizontal alignment and spacing of elements such as the menu items and palette squares. Grid is not explicitly used in this version of my CSS; instead, flow-based layouts and multi-column text are used where appropriate . Flexbox provides responsive alignment for inline navigation, while the design remains simple and organized across all screen sizes.

## New Subpage

The new subpage serves as an additional content area within the Breakfast Ideas website, expanding the overall structure while maintaining consistent design and navigation. It is fully integrated into the site by being linked both from an existing menu page and from the site map. The page follows the established formatting standards by beginning with an h1 heading and using well-organized semantic elements such as section,article, and figure to present meaningful information. It includes unique metadata in the head, incorporates a properly captioned image using figure and figcaption, and maintains readable, accessible content. The page has been validated to ensure correct HTML structure and compliance with project requirements.

## Image Optimization

Images are optimized through responsive CSS using width: 100% and height: auto, ensuring they scale correctly on all device sizes. Each image includes width and height attributes to prevent layout shifts and uses loading="lazy" to improve performance by deferring off-screen image loading. Meaningful, accessible alt text is also provided, helping screen readers interpret the images properly and improving overall accessibility.

## Hero Image Design

I chose the image beause i, Intended on making a favicon for the website, although I thought it would be a good background image bcause it concludes what the site has to offer, it is a plate with assorted breakfast. It appears above the contact form pn the cpntact  page, What I did was place it center , a full screens width. I added a semi-transparent dark overlay, creating strong contrast while keeping the image visible, and centered the heading both vertically and horizontally for a balanced, welcoming layout.
