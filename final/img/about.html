        <h2>About This Site</h2>
        <p>This site is all about breakfast! It is full of ideas, recipes, and inspiration for both sweet and savory breakfasts. The goal is to make mornings easier and more enjoyable, giving visitors simple, delicious options to start their day.</p>

        <p>The site is for early risers, people who are just beginning to live on their own, or anyone learning to cook for themselves. It is especially helpful for those who feel indecisive about what to make in the morning and want quick, tasty ideas.</p>

        <p>I was inspired to create this site because breakfast can be stressful when you do not know what to make. I wanted to give people a space where they could find ideas, learn new recipes, and start their mornings feeling confident and happy.</p>

        <h2>Future Plans</h2>
        <p>In the future, I would like to add more interactive features, like a recipe search, a breakfast planner, or a section for user-submitted recipes. I also want to explore new technologies such as JavaScript for dynamic content, CSS animations for a more engaging look, and maybe even a small app version to help people plan their mornings on the go.</p>
